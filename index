            <p class=intro> This page is about nothing at all. Nothing at all BUT aesthetically pleasing ish. I love that you're here, but nowhere at all? Where is here? What is this cyberspace we float in? Who is this body you're in? No one knows, all we know is nothing. <br>  So be nothing, and enjoy this wonderful ish. This wonderful aesthically pleasing, nothing-at-all ish.
